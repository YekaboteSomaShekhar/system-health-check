# system-health-check

## Overview  
The **System Health Check Script** collects and logs key system performance metrics such as date/time, CPU usage, memory, and disk usage and active services — all logged into a timestamped file (healthlog.txt) for easy tracking and debugging.

This project demonstrates automation, shell scripting, and system administration skills — useful for DevOps, system monitoring, and infrastructure management.
